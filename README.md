# Currency-Convertor-ChatBot
Through this project, I learned how to integrate Python with Dialogflow, a powerful natural language understanding platform, to create a conversational interface for users to convert currencies seamlessly. I honed my skills in Python programming, particularly in handling APIs for currency conversion and parsing user input. Additionally, I gained insights into chatbot design principles, including conversation flow, error handling, and user experience optimization. This project not only enhanced my technical proficiency but also provided me with practical experience in project management, problem-solving, and collaboration, laying a strong foundation for my journey into the world of software development and AI-driven applications.
